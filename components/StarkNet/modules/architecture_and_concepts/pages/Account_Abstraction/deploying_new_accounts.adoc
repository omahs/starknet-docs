= Deploying new accounts

Since xref:documentation:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.1[StarkNet version 0.10.1] the historical method of deploying accounts on StarkNet, the `deploy` transaction has been removed.

It has now been replaced with the `deploy_account` transaction which allows you to deploy an account and additionally be charged fairly for the deployment.

## Deploy account transaction

In order to deploy a new account on StarkNet you need to complete the following steps:

* Decide on the account type you want to deploy
* Compute your would-be account address off-chain
* Send funds to this address

Once the address has enough funds to pay for the deployment, you can then send a `deploy_account` transaction.

## Transaction flow

Upon receiving a `deploy_account` transaction, the sequencer will:

* Verify that the address has funds to pay for the deployment
* Execute the constructor with the given arguments
* Execute the `&lowbar;&lowbar;validate_deploy&lowbar;&lowbar;` entry point (See below)
* Charge fee from the new account address
* Advance the nonce to 1

## Validate deploy


There are two potential issues that arise from sending a `deploy_account` transaction without any extra validation:

* Sequencers having the ability to charge arbitrarily high fees, thus potentially draining user funds from a pre-funded account
* A bad actor having the ability to carry out a sequencer DOS attack by sending multiple, invalid `deploy_account` transactions. This would result in the sequencer not being compensated for work completed.


To prevent the above scenarios, a new optional validation entrypoint is provided: `&lowbar;&lowbar;validate_deploy&lowbar;&lowbar;`.

This enforces some limitations on `deploy_account` transactions, via validation execution namely:

* Limited # of Cairo steps
* Limited # of builtin applications
* No external contract calls (library calls and self-calls are allowed)

This entrypoint should be included in any accounts or contracts that wish to allow this updated flow.

In future versions these same limitations will be introduced to the constructor as well.

### Using validate deploy

`&lowbar;&lowbar;validate_deploy&lowbar;&lowbar;` expects the following arguments:

* class hash
* contract address salt
* constructor arguments - the arguments expected by the contractâ€™s constructor (this will be enforced in the compiler).

Consider an account with the following constructor signature:

[#constructor_signature]
[source,cairo]
----
@constructor
func constructor{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    _public_key: felt
)
----

Then the signature of `&lowbar;&lowbar;validate_deploy`&lowbar;&lowbar; must be:

[#call_validate_deploy]
[source,cairo]
----
func __validate_deploy__{
    syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr, ecdsa_ptr: SignatureBuiltin*
}(class_hash: felt, contract_address_salt: felt, _public_key: felt)
----

[NOTE]
====
The transaction hash and `max_fee` are accessible through the `get_tx_info` system call.

## API changes

In addition to the new transaction type, the following minor API changes apply since xref:documentation:starknet_versions:version_notes.adoc#version0.10.1[StarkNet version 0.10.1]:

* Renaming `contract_address` to `sender_address` in version 1 invoke transactions.
* The `entry_point_type` field is removed from invoke transactions (this affects the `get_block` and `get_transaction` feeder gateway endpoints). Note that this information is now reflected by the transaction type, hence the field is redundant.
* The `entry_point_selector` field is removed from version 1 invoke transactions.
